To ask Malcolm:
1. Navbar overlaps sections when sections wrapped in '.container', altho body margin= 65px
2. Photos and images positions messes up, and does not center, stays on left/right when mobile size. This is after adding '.container' to sections containing images
+4. footer bar is in the middle of the screen although set 'bottom: 0;'
+5. index.html 
   --> Carousel not centered
   --> Carousel - Captions not centered disappears
7. Border does not color grey although indicated in elements
+8. Page background images do not display when viewed from online (github.io) when set to both "images/pic.jpg" and "/images/pic.jpg"
    Conversely, adding "/" on Local machine (/mages/pic.jpg) will show page backgrounds [using LiveServer]...Leaving "/" out does not display the page background for this case. interestingly.
